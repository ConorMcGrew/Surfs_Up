# Surfs_Up

## Overview
  In order to better inform W. Avy's future business, we looked at temperature data from June and December. This should be a good indication of whether the business is viable year-round. 

## Results

* While the maximum temperatures differ by only two degrees for June and December, the minimum temperature for June was 64.0 degrees while the minimum temperature for December was 56.0 degrees. 
* The mean temperature for June was 74.94 degrees while the mean temperature for December was 71.04 degrees. 
* 50% of the days in June were 75.0 degrees or above while less than 25% percent of the days in December were 75.0 degrees or above. 

## Summary
Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
The days of June are, on average, 3.9 degrees warmer than the days in December. Additionally, the standard deviation for June is also much smaller than that of December, indicating that temperatures in June were much clustered around the mean (the temperature on any given day is more likely to be near the average temperature). Finally, the extreme temperatures for June are much more condusive to the activities that W. Avy is trying to market. The bottom 25% of temperatures (73.0 - 64.0) in June is much higher than than the bottom 25% of temperatures (69.0 - 56.0) in December (even cold days in June are not likely to be as cold as those in Decemeber), while the top 50% of temperatures in June (75.0 - 85.0) are appropriately warm for both ice cream and surfing (over half the days in June seem suitable). 
Two additonal queries to further our understanding: 
- Precipitation: if we know the relative precipitation for each month, we know how likely people are to engage in surfing and ice cream consumption. Precipitation likely disuades surfing (particularly, if the precipitation involves snow or lightning).
- Months: we should also query months that would be considered "off-peak", such as October and March. Those months are unlikely to have very many tourists, and each marks the start of a new season, and thus drastic weather changes. Knowing if the weather is poor for extended periods of time during those months would be beneficial as well.
